                                            The purpose of this assignment is to get you practice with loops and functions in a fun, visual application.  This is the IDS 301/Python version of the <a href = "../../../CS173_S2020/Assignments/HW4_ChaosGame">CS 173/Java</a> assignment, so you may want to talk to some people in CS 173 about the logic as you're working through this.

                                                <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">Fractals</a> are beautiful mathematical shapes which are <i>self-similar</i>, which means they are made up of smaller parts of themselves.  Many shapes in nature are approximately fractals.  Take a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern">fern</a>, for example.  As shown below, it's possible to make a fern out of smaller ferns which are rotated, translated (moved), and scaled, but which are otherwise exactly the same.  And those smaller ferns, in turn, are made up of even smaller versions of the exact same fern:
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                In this assignment, you will be making another type of fractal by simulating a probabilistic game known as <b>the chaos game</b>.  This game consists of choosing some points on a polygon, and then drawing a bunch more points on the inside of that polygon by following a bunch of random steps.  As such, it is a great assignment for exploring loops.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                In this assignment, you will make a fractal called the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle">Sierpinski Triangle</a>.  You will start with three points on the 2D Cartesian plane that form a triangle.  These are parameters that you will send into a void function which does the drawing.  Each point has both an x and a y coordinate, so the points are
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li><b>a</b> = (ax, ay)</li>
                                                    <li><b>b</b> = (bx, by)</li>
                                                    <li><b>c</b> = (cx, cy)</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                Given these three initial points, an algorithm to randomly draw points on the Sierpinski Triangle is as follows:
                                                <ol>
                                                    <li>First, draw the point <b>a</b>, and designate this as the last point drawn</li>
                                                    <li>Randomly choose a point that's either <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, or <b>c</b>.  Draw a point halfway in between the last point drawn and this randomly chosen point</li>
                                                    <li>Repeat step 2 for until the chosen number of samples has been drawn.</li>
                                                </ol>
                                                The point halfway in between a point <b>p</b> with coordinates (px, py) and a point <b>q</b> with coordinates (qx, qy) can be computed by averaging the coordinates of the two points.  That is, the x-coordinate of the halfway point is (px + qx)/2, and the y-coordinate of the halfway point is (py + qy)/2.
                                            </p>

                                                As an example, consider the triangle with points <b>a</b> = (0, 0), <b>b</b> = (1, 0), and <b>c</b> = (1, 1).  Here are the points we draw
                                                <ol>
                                                    <li>As always, we first draw <b>a</b></li>
                                                    <li>Let's say the next randomly chosen point is <b>c</b>.  We'd draw our second point halfway in between <b>a</b> and <b>c</b>, which is at (0.5, 0.5).</li>
                                                    <li>Let's then say the next point chosen is <b>b</b>.  We'd draw the third point halfway in between (0.5, 0.5) and <b>b</b> = (1, 0), which is at (0.75, 0.25).</li>
                                                    <li>Let's then say the next point chosen is <b>c</b> again.    We'd then draw the fourth point halfway in between (0.75, 0.25) and <b>c</b> = (1, 1), which is (0.875, 0.625)</li>.  
                                                </ol>

                                                    For extra credit, you may draw another fractal using points on a quadrilateral with points <b>a</b> = (ax, ay), <b>b</b> = (bx, by), <b>c</b> = (cx, cy), and <b>d</b> = (dx, dy).  The steps are very similar to the Sierpinski Triangle steps, with one minor difference, shown in bold below
                                                </p>
                                                <ol>
                                                    <li>First, draw the point <b>a</b>, and designate this as the last point drawn</li>
                                                    <li>Randomly choose a point that's either <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, or <b>d</b>, <b>as long as it is different from the last point you chose</b> (for instance, if I chose <b>a</b> last time, I must choose either <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, or <b>d</b> this time).  Draw a point halfway in between the last point drawn and this randomly chosen point</li>
                                                    <li>Repeat step 2 for until the chosen number of samples has been drawn.</li>

                                                    <b>If you don't keep track of the point you chose last time and just randomly pick one of the four points on the quad each time, you will end up with the picture below, which is not a fractal</b>.  So if you see a result like that, you know you didn't follow the steps properly.

                                                You should create a new file called <code>Quad.py</code>.  This file should contain a function <code>draw_quad</code> which takes as parameters the x and y coordinates of 4 points on a quadrilateral, as well as the number of points to draw.  Try calling your function with points sampled on a square, for example:
                                                </p>

The order of your parameters should also be similar, you just need two more coordinates than before to include the fourth point.

                                                    The rules for generating a Sierpinski Triangle generalize naturally to higher dimensions.  So it is possible to make a <a href = "https://www.think-maths.co.uk/sites/default/files/2018-01/think_maths_-_sierpinski_tetrahedron_worksheet.pdf">Sierpinski Tetrahedron</a> by choosing 4 non-coplanar points in 3D and running the exact same algorithm, choosing one of the four points at random to which to go halfway.  To get extra credit, you should simulate this by drawing a bunch of small spheres at different locations in <a href = "https://vpython.org/">vpython</a>.  Here are two screenshots of what this should look like if you do it correctly:
